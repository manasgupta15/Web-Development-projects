Welcome to our YouTube Landing Page project! This project is a recreation of the YouTube homepage using HTML and CSS. It provides an immersive and user-friendly experience for visitors, resembling the familiar look and feel of YouTube.

Our YouTube Landing Page project serves as a demonstration of our HTML and CSS skills, showcasing a responsive and visually appealing design. It includes features such as a search bar, recommended videos, user account options, and a layout that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
Whether you're here to explore the code, learn from our implementation, or simply enjoy the nostalgic design of YouTube, we hope you find this project both informative and engaging.
Feel free to explore the code, run the project, and provide feedback. We appreciate your interest in our work!
